# MNIST GAN and Classifier Study

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explored how a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can generate digit images similar to the MNIST dataset and how well a classifier trained on MNIST performs when tested on both real and fake images.

The steps followed were:

1. Trained a **GAN** on the MNIST dataset.
2. Used the GAN to **generate fake digit images**.
3. Trained a **digit classifier** on the MNIST dataset.
4. Tested the classifier on both **real MNIST images** and **GAN-generated images**.

## ðŸ”¬ Observations

* Classifier error rate on **real MNIST data**: **1%**
* Classifier error rate on **GAN-generated fake data**: **4%**

This shows that GAN-generated digits are fairly realistic, but they still contain small distortions that make classification slightly harder compared to real MNIST images.


## ðŸ“Š Results

* GAN was successful in generating visually convincing digits.
* Classifier performed slightly worse on fake images, highlighting subtle differences between GAN data and real MNIST data.
